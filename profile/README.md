We are excited to launch a brand new initiative - 🌟**Pega Skills Days**🌟, an exclusive event designed for students and fresh graduates eager to expand their technical expertise! 
This event is all about **hands-on learning** - featuring practical presentations and/or training sessions led by our **top experts**. 
Presentations were prepared based on the **feedback** of our former Interns, who let us know what is currently missing in their studies.
