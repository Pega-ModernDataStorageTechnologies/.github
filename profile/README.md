We are excited to launch a brand new initiative - ğŸŒŸPega Skills DaysğŸŒŸ, an exclusive event designed for students and fresh graduates eager to expand their technical expertise! This event is all about hands-on learning - featuring practical presentations and/or training sessions led by our top experts. Presentations were prepared based on the feedback of our former Interns, who let us know what is currently missing in their studies.
